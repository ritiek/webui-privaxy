# webui-privaxy

This repository contains a fork of [Privaxy](https://github.com/Barre/privaxy) v0.3.1 that has been dockerized and pushed to GHCR with Github Actions located [here](https://github.com/deetungsten/webui-privaxy/pkgs/container/webui-privaxy). The main purpose is to maintain the web UI functionality from the original Privaxy v0.3.1 release. By containerizing Privaxy, it can now be easily run on a server or locally without installing the npm related tools.

## Installation and Usage

The front end code expects the `IP_ADDRESS` environment variable to be defined, otherwise it will default to `0.0.0.0` which will break functionality when used remotely. The `IP_ADDRESS` variable should be set to the IP address of the server running the container. This can be defined either in the `docker-compose.yml` file, when running the container manually with docker run, or as an environment variable when using the prebuilt image.

The current network settings has to be `--network host` or else binding to the host IP address will not work. This is a limitation of the current codebase and will be fixed in the future by shifting to relative URI paths rather than hard coded IP addresses.

### Persistence

Since everything is dockerized, the cert and keys need to stored somewhere so that new ones do not get generated when you restart an image. The codebase is modified to save the files in `/.cache/webui-privaxy`. You can mount any local folder or volume to that location. If you ever find the need to generate a fresh set of certificates and keys, you can do so by simply deleting this folder in your local environment.

### Using prebuilt docker image

1. Change the IP address to your server IP address `docker-compose.yml`
2. `docker-compose up`

### Local

1.  `docker build -t webui-privaxy .`
2.  (Optional) `export IP_ADDRESS=<SERVER IP ADDRESS>`
3.  ```bash
    docker run -d \
       --name webui-privaxy \
       --network host \
       -e "IP_ADDRESS=<SERVER IP ADDRESS>" \
       -v $HOME/.cache/webui-privaxy:/.cache/webui-privaxy \
       webui-privaxy
    ```

### Disclaimer

Similar to the original version, there is no authentication for the proxy or webUI. The best way to access this remotely outside of your home is with something like Tailscale or Wireguard.

## TODO

- [ ] Update files to match Privaxy updates since v0.3.1
- [ ] Automatic network binding so IP_ADDRESS does not need to be declared
- [ ] Add Cloudflare tunneling (Cloudflare One) for authentication

## From the original repo, still relevant to this fork.

### Using the rust toolchain

1. Begin by [installing rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. Install rust's wasm target: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`

3. [Install trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/#install).

4. [Install nodejs as well as npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) (at least v14).

5. Clone this repository.

6. Build the web gui by running `cd web_frontend && npm i && trunk build --release && cd ..`

7. Build the server by running `cd privaxy && cargo build --release.`

8. Run privaxy using `cargo run --release --bin privaxy`.

### Local system configuration

1. Navigate to the web gui at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, click on "Download CA certificate".

2. Install the downloaded certificate locally.

## About

Privaxy is a MITM HTTP(s) proxy that sits in between HTTP(s) talking applications, such as a web browser and HTTP servers, such as those serving websites.

By establishing a two-way tunnel between both ends, Privaxy is able to block network requests based on URL patterns and to inject scripts as well as styles into HTML documents.

Operating at a lower level, Privaxy is both more efficient as well as more streamlined than browser add-on-based blockers. A single instance of Privaxy on a small virtual machine, server or even, on the same computer as the traffic is originating from, can filter thousands of requests per second while requiring a very small amount of memory.

Privaxy is not limited by the browserâ€™s APIs and can operate with any HTTP traffic, not only the traffic flowing from web browsers.

Privaxy is also way more capable than DNS-based blockers as it is able to operate directly on URLs and to inject resources into web pages.

## Features

- Suppport for [Adblock Plus filters](https://adblockplus.org/filter-cheatsheet), such as [easylist](https://easylist.to/).

- Web graphical user interface with a statistics display as well as a live request explorer.

- Support for uBlock origin's `js` syntax.

- Support for uBlock origin's `redirect` syntax.

- Support for uBlock origin's scriptlets.

- Browser and HTTP client agnostic.

- Support for custom filters.

- Support for excluding hosts from the MITM pipeline.

- Support for protocol upgrades, such as with websockets.

- Automatic filter lists updates.

- Very low resource usage.

- Around 50MB of memory with approximately 320 000 filters enabled.

- Able to filter thousands of requests per second on a small machine.
